# Project Eivee

**Please note: This project is still under development.**

Eivee is a Discord Bot developed using Python and the Discord.py library. This project is a collaborative effort with ScreamsinMeow (available on Github). All coding is performed by Physalia77. Once completed, our bot will be available for everyone to use.

Eivee was initiated as a fun project between two friends. While we do not anticipate a massive response, we are hopeful that if it does gain traction, it will aid in managing your Discord server, providing control and enhancing engagement for you and your members.

Eivee offers a multitude of features such as moderation, events, discord management, and even an economy system for casino games. We plan to introduce many more features in the future, particularly to the economy system, as well as to the bot in general.
